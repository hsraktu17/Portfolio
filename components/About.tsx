            In school, my programming journey began with C++, laying the groundwork for my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. As I progressed into college, I further honed my skills in Python, C++, and Java, with a particular emphasis on Java for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) during my second year. Platforms like LeetCode became invaluable resources for sharpening my abilities and tackling complex coding challenges.

            Transitioning into the realm of software development, I initially explored mobile development but soon found myself drawn to the vast opportunities of web development. Immersing myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I began crafting dynamic and engaging web applications. A pivotal moment in my journey came when I embarked on building a Spotify clone, a project that not only refined my skills but also ignited a deep-seated passion for full-stack development.

            With ReactJS, Express, and Node.js as my companions, I ventured into the world of full-stack development. Embracing the intricacies of the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—I broadened my horizons, transitioning from a frontend focus to tackling both frontend and backend challenges. This journey continues to fuel my drive to craft innovative and impactful web solutions.
